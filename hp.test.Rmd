Hi Joanna!
Let's make a graph of Harry Potter v. Draco Malvoy acts of aggression.

```{r}

hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% # Keep data on Harry and Draco
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% # Keep data only on Name, book, agg.per.mention
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") + # Make color of column according to Name (Draco or Harry), make bars side-by-side instead of stacked
  coord_flip() # Flip x- and y- axes


hp_graph
```
